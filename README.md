chess
==================

# Installation

Requires Python 3

# Usage

Run the following command:

python3 chess.py

# Future changes
Still incomplete. Program can handle check and checkmate but still does not have stalemate or pawn promotions. Also requires some changes to be more user friendly and playable(i.e. cancel move)
